## Part1: Data cleaning,merging, EDA and initial analysis on fish farms data using R
Aquaculture (fish farms) are an important part of the Scottish economy. Fish are grown in large cages, either in the sea or in lakes. The industry involves the use of animals and has an impact on the environment, so there is an increased focus in monitoring the fish farms, and keeping records of any incidents there may be.

The two datasets used were:
• escapes.csv: contains records of fish escapes, i.e. incidents where some of the fish in the cages have escaped into the wild. This is undesirable and is reported.
• analysis.csv: the results of water analysis using a number of components. This file has been selected to contain records which somehow align with some of the escapes data.

The following tasks were carried out in R:
1. Prepare each individual dataset for learning. You will need to perform some exploratory data analysis in order to justify your data preparation. This may include:
a. Cleaning the data.
b. Transforming data / attributes.
c. Removing data.
d. Imputing data.
e. Discarding features/attributes.
f. Deleting instances.
3. Integrate the 2 datasets together into a merged dataset called escapesPlus and was saved to a file called escapesPlus.csv.
4. Additional exploratory data analysis of the dataset, highlighting any interesting information. Note that data exploration may involve the application of statistical functions and/or the use of visualisations. Prepare this new dataset for learning if needed.
5. ONE other learning task different from tasks 1-3 and, ideally, it complements the work undertaken in previous tasks.
